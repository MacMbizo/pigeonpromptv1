## 3. Core Process

**Individual User Flow:**
Users begin by creating prompts in the IDE, testing them against multiple AI models, iterating based on results, organizing prompts in the Hub with version control, and optionally deploying successful prompts as API endpoints.

**Team Collaboration Flow:**
Team members create prompts collaboratively, use pull request workflows for review and approval, maintain shared prompt libraries, coordinate through team workspaces, and deploy enterprise-grade solutions with monitoring.

**Enterprise Operations Flow:**
Enterprise users leverage advanced analytics for prompt performance optimization, implement compliance and security controls, scale deployments across multiple environments, and maintain operational oversight through comprehensive monitoring.
