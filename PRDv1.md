**AI Prompt Engineering Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Version:** 2.0
**Status:** Approved for Planning
**Author:** SaaS Architect Pro

**1. Introduction & Vision**

**1.1. Elevator Pitch**

An integrated, professional-grade AI Prompt Engineering Platform that
empowers developers and power users to craft, test, manage, and
collaborate on complex AI prompts. The platform combines a secure,
local-file-aware context builder with an advanced multi-model execution
engine, robust versioning, and a community-driven discovery library to
maximize the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs).

**1.2. Problem Statement**

- **Ineffective Prompting:** Users struggle to craft complex,
  context-rich prompts, leading to subpar AI-generated results, wasted
  time, and frustration.

- **Fragmented Tooling:** Prompt engineering workflows are scattered
  across text editors, spreadsheets, and disparate web UIs. There is no
  single, integrated environment for this critical task.

- **Lack of Reusability:** Users constantly reinvent prompts that others
  have already perfected, with no systematic way to save, share, and
  reuse best practices.

- **Poor Collaboration:** Teams lack the tools to collaborate on prompt
  development, leading to inconsistent AI usage and quality across an
  organization.

**1.3. Target Audience & Personas**

- **Primary Persona: "Alex, the AI-Focused Developer"**

  - **Needs:** To provide large codebases as context, test prompts
    against multiple models, integrate prompting into their Git
    workflow, and get AI assistance for tasks like refactoring,
    documentation, and test generation.

  - **Pain Points:** Manually copying/pasting code, exceeding token
    limits, and managing different prompt syntaxes for different models.

- **Secondary Persona: "Maria, the Power User & Content Creator"**

  - **Needs:** To create and manage a library of high-quality prompts
    for marketing, content generation, and data analysis. She needs to
    discover what works and share best practices with her team.

  - **Pain Points:** Finding proven prompts, organizing her prompt
    library, and tracking the effectiveness of different approaches.

**1.4. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**

The first comprehensive, developer-first prompt engineering platform
that unifies local file context building, advanced prompt design,
multi-model testing, and collaborative version control into a single,
seamless workflow.
